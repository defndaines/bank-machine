# bank-machine

Bank Machine is a clojure app that does the following:
 - reads a resource file containing drawings of bank account numbers,
 - translates those drawings into account numbers using digits,
 - analyzes the validity of those translations, and
 - displays the results to the user.

It is based on the Bank OCR coding kata here:
